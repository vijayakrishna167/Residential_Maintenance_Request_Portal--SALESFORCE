# 🏠 Residential Maintenance Request Portal

## 📌 Problem Statement
Managing residential maintenance requests is often inefficient when handled manually.

- Residents can submit and track repair requests.
- Technicians can manage assigned tasks without overlap.
- Property managers can approve high-cost repairs and monitor reports.
- The system ensures timely updates and transparency through notifications.
