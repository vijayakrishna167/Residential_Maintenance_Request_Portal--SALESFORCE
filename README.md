## 📝 Problem Statement

[cite_start]The core problem is the lack of a centralized and efficient system for managing residential maintenance requests[cite: 1]. This project aims to replace a manual or disjointed process with a digital solution that automates tracking, assignments, and stakeholder communication.

### Key Challenges

* [cite_start]**For Residents:** No straightforward way to submit repair requests or track their progress[cite: 5, 12].
* [cite_start]**For Maintenance Staff:** Difficulty in tracking all requests, assigning priority, and preventing duplicate work orders for the same unit[cite: 4, 6].
* [cite_start]**For Property Managers:** Lack of an efficient process for approving high-cost repairs and generating performance and cost reports[cite: 7, 11].

## ⚙️ Business Process Flow

2.  [cite_start]**Triage:** A supervisor checks the request's priority[cite: 15].
3.  [cite_start]**Assignment:** The request is assigned to an available maintenance technician[cite: 15].

5.  [cite_start]**Resolution:** The technician resolves the issue and updates the work order[cite: 15].
6.  [cite_start]**Notification:** An automated email is sent to the resident confirming the request is complete[cite: 15].
